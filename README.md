This website is designed to show examples of personal data visualisation projects that I have done in my spare time over the years. I am currently a data analyst based in Australia and have had an interest in data visualisation for a number of years. However I haven't always had a lot of spare time to devote to this work.  

I have studied biomedical science and applied epidemiology and am always looking to expand on and improve my data analysis/visualisation skills.  

When I first became interested in data visualisation I started using Tableau Public and really enjoyed how intuitive it is to use. I have also recently become interested in learning how to use R and have taught myself some skills using the numerous excellent online resources that are available.
